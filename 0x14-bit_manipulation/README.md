# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
This project aims to teach about bit manipulation

# Concepts

For this project, we are expected to look at the following concepts.
- Bit manipulation 
- Bitwise operators 

# Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- All your header files should be include guarded

# Files

- **0-binary_to_uint.c**: a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- **1-print_binary.c**: a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- **2-get_bit.c**: a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- **3-set_bit.c**: a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- **4-clear_bit.c**: a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- **5-flip_bits.c**: a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
